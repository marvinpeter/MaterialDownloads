# FireDownloads
Manage your downloads from Chrome's toolbar like you would do with Firefox.

## Description
Fire Downloads is an open source extension for Google Chrome which adds a download manager to the toolbar and disables the download shelf. Downloads then are sent to the toolbar instead of to the shelf like they would in Firefox Quantum.

To install this extension head to the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fire-downloads/lkipihmhkkecjfkmgpphhipoenalokka).
